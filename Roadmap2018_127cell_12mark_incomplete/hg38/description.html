<h2>Description</h2>
The Integrative and Discriminative EPigenome Annotation System (IDEAS) method for simultaneous two-dimensional segmentation (Zhang et al. NAR 2016; Zhang and Hardison, NAR 2017) was used to run on 12 epigenetic marks in 127 cell types in the Roadmap Epigenomics project. 
This was run on build hg19, then the segmentations were lifted to hg38.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
The contributions of each epigenetic feature to each of the states is shown in the figure, along with the color code and their abundance in 127 cell types. Briefly, warm colors are associated with activity and cold colors with inactivity. In more detail, red denotes a state with a promoter-like signature, yellow denote states with an enhancer-like signature, and green denotes a signature for elongating RNA polymerase. In contrast, the grey states convey various combinations of no to low signals for any of the features, and blue states generally correspond to repressive signals.
